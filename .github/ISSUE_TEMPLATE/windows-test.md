- PS5 wired or wireless:
- Portal firmware:

## Steps reached

- [ ] Baseline passed, picture/control and reconnection normal
- [ ] 65 tested
- [ ] 100 tested (only after 65)
- [ ] 200 tested (only after 100)

## Observations
- Profile:
- Portal displayed resolution/bitrate (not just console target):
- Image quality and stutter/input response:
- Normal connection still works after test:

## Redacted diagnostic fields
Paste `counts`, `unique_mutated_sequences`, `ps5_messages`, `egress_witness`, `restoration_errors` and a redacted error message. Target bitrate is not actual video throughput. Never attach the entire experiment folder.
